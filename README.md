</div>

### About this Lab
This lab focuses on adding interactive animation to HTML5 canvas using [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/), a HTML5 2d canvas library.

## A. How does it works?
1. Every thing starts from `Konva.Stage` that contains several userâ€™s layers (`Konva.Layer`) [https://konvajs.org/docs/overview.html](https://konvajs.org/docs/overview.html).
2. Each layer can contain shapes, groups of shapes, or groups of other groups.
3. The stage, layers, groups, and shapes are virtual nodes, similar to DOM nodes in an HTML page. E.g.:
   ```
                Stage
                   |
            +------+------+
            |             |
          Layer         Layer
            |             |
      +-----+-----+     Shape
      |           |
    Group       Group
      |           |
      +       +---+---+
      |       |       |
   Shape   Group    Shape
              |
              +
              |
            Shape
   ```

## B. Setup
1. Open `html/A.html` in browser (chrome/firefox/ie).
2. Open `js/A.js` in text editor.
3. Read and understand how a stage and a layer are created.

## C. Adding Mouse event to the whole stage
1. Add a mouseout event to the stage.
   ```js
   stage.on('mouseout', function() {
       writeMessage('Mouseout canvas');
   });
   ```
2. Add a mousemove event to the stage and display the mouse position.
   ```js
   stage.on('mousemove', function() {
       var mousePos = stage.getPointerPosition();
       var x = mousePos.x - 190;
       var y = mousePos.y - 40;
       writeMessage('x: ' + x + ', y: ' + y);
   });
   ```

## D. Associate events with different shapes on a canvas
This exercise was taken from [HTML5 Canvas Shape Events](https://konvajs.org/docs/events/Binding_Events.html).
1. Open `html/B.html` in browser (chrome/firefox/ie).
2. Open `js/B.js` in text editor.

### Draw a triangle as follows:
1. Add following triangle drawing function.
   ```js
   var triangle = new Konva.RegularPolygon({
       x: 80,
	   y: 120,
	   sides: 3,
	   radius: 80,
	   fill: '#00D2FF',
	   stroke: 'black',
	   strokeWidth: 4
   });
   ```

2. Add a mouseout event to the triangle.
   ```js
   triangle.on('mouseout', function() {
       writeMessage('Mouseout triangle');
   });
   ```

3. Add a mousemove event to the triangle and display the mouse position.
   ```js
   triangle.on('mousemove', function() {
       var mousePos = stage.getPointerPosition();
       var x = mousePos.x - 190;
       var y = mousePos.y - 40;
       writeMessage('x: ' + x + ', y: ' + y);
   });
   ```

4. Add the triangle to the layer.
   ```js
   layer.add(triangle);
   ```

### Draw circle as follows;
1. Add following circle drawing function.
   ```js
   var circle = new Konva.Circle({
       x: 230,
       y: 100,
       radius: 60,
       fill: 'red',
       stroke: 'black',
       strokeWidth: 4,
   });
   ```

2. Add following events to the circle.
   ```js
   circle.on('mouseover', function () {
       writeMessage('Mouseover circle');
   });
   circle.on('mouseout', function () {
       writeMessage('Mouseout circle');
   });
   circle.on('mousedown', function () {
       writeMessage('Mousedown circle');
   });
   circle.on('mouseup', function () {
       writeMessage('Mouseup circle');
   });
   ```

3. Add the circle to the layer.
   ```js
   layer.add(circle);
   ```

## E. Drag and Drop an Image
This exercise was taken from [HTML5 Canvas Drag and Drop an Image](https://konvajs.org/docs/drag_and_drop/Drag_an_Image.html).
1. Open `html/C.html` in browser (chrome/firefox/ie).
2. Open `js/C.js` in text editor.
3. Add the `Konva.Image` in the centre of the stage and make it draggable.
   ```js
   var pokemonImg = new Konva.Image({
       image: imageObj,
       x: stage.width() / 2 - 250 / 2,
       y: stage.height() / 2 - 247 / 2,
       width: 250,
       height: 247,
       draggable: true
   });
   ```
4. Change the cursor style.
   ```js
   pokemonImg.on('mouseover', function() {
       document.body.style.cursor = 'pointer';
   });

   pokemonImg.on('mouseout', function() {
       document.body.style.cursor = 'default';
   });
   ```
5. Add the KonvaImage to the layer.
   ```js
   layer.add(pokemonImg);
   ```
6. Add the layer to the stage.
   ```js
   stage.add(layer);
   ```
6. Load the image as follows;
   ```js
   var imageObj = new Image();

   imageObj.onload = function() {
	   drawImage(this);
   };

   imageObj.src = '../imgs/Bulbasour.png';
   ```

## F. Free Drawing
This exercise was taken from [Free Drawing Konva Demo](https://konvajs.org/docs/sandbox/Free_Drawing.html).
1. Open `html/todo.html` in browser (chrome/firefix/ie).
2. Open `html/todo.html` and `js/todo.js` in text editor.
3. Read the code and understand it.

## G. To Do Questions
Answer each question in the sections indicated by comments. If you need to modify other parts of the code, you can do it but remember to leave a comment saying which TODO question is related to the modification. E.g. `\\ this line is part of TODO 1` or `\\ part of TODO 1`

<img src="imgs/todo.gif" />

1. Add options to change and use at least 3 different brush colour.
2. Add an option to clear the whole canvas at once.
